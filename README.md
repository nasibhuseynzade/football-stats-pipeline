# Football Data Pipeline

A data engineering project to extract, transform, and load (ETL) football match data using the [Football Data API](https://www.football-data.org/). This project focuses on building a pipeline to fetch and analyze Premier League match data, with plans to expand to more complex datasets.

First Experiment - Normalizing data 
Second Experiment - Transforming matches data to a teams standing table
Third Experiment - Team standing table with a daily scheduler
## Features
- Extract match data from the Football Data API.
- Transform raw JSON data into a clean, structured format.
